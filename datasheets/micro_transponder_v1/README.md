This is a transponder intended for indoor microdrones. It's not that bright, 
which is fine when flying only a few feet from the receiver. It's also very 
small, which is good when every milligram counts.

It can still be programmed using alligator clips on the sides. The lettering 
on the back will show you which pad goes where (PB0, PB1, etc.). See the 
ATtiny85 datasheet for how they connect to the physical pins and their 
extended features.

Solder the +5V and GND pads to the power. If necessary, a +3.7V input (such as 
from a 1S lipo cell) should be enough.
